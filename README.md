2.	Introduction
In an increasingly digital world, many small enterprises continue to struggle with visibility and access to online markets. These businesses often lack the technical expertise or resources to create websites, process digital payments, or engage customers effectively. GoOnline was conceptualized as a solution to bridge this gap.
The project aims to democratize access to digital technology for small business owners, particularly in developing economies where online adoption remains low. Through GoOnline, even a small shop owner can create an online profile, list products, receive orders, and track performance metrics without needing prior technical knowledge.
The platform’s strength lies in its scalability, fault tolerance, and collaboration capabilities. It ensures that business operations remain smooth, even during high demand, and allows multiple users to work together seamlessly.

6.	System Architecture
The architecture follows a microservices-based 3-tier design, ensuring modularity and scalability.
6.1. Architectural Layers
•	Presentation Layer (Frontend): Developed with React and TailwindCSS, hosted via a CDN or Vercel. It communicates with the backend through secure HTTPS requests and WebSockets for real-time updates.
•	Application Layer (Backend): Built on Node.js and Express, this layer handles business logic, authentication, data processing, and API communication. It uses a modular service structure (auth, business, marketplace, collaboration, payments).
•	Data Layer: Uses PostgreSQL for relational data (users, transactions, commissions) and Redis for caching and real-time state management.
6.2. Supporting Infrastructure
•	Containerization: All services run in Docker containers for consistent environments.
•	Orchestration: Kubernetes manages scaling, failover, and resource allocation.
•	Message Broker: RabbitMQ handles asynchronous tasks (emails, notifications).
•	Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana monitor system health, latency, and uptime.
•	Logging: Elasticsearch and Kibana aggregate logs for debugging and auditing.
________________________________________
7.	Backend Design
The backend is organized into independent services connected through REST APIs.
7.1. Core Services
Service	Responsibility
Auth Service	Manages registration, login, JWT tokens, and OAuth integration.
Business Service	Handles business creation, profile updates, and storefront data.
Marketplace Service	Lists businesses, manages search, filters, and recommendations.
Payment Service	Processes transactions, supports mobile money and credit card payments.
Collaboration Service	Manages chat, shared tasks, and real-time notifications.
Analytics Service	Collects usage data, generates reports, and visualizes insights.
Commission Service	Calculates and records agent commissions.
Each service uses a dedicated PostgreSQL schema and communicates with others through internal APIs.
7.2. API Gateway
A lightweight Node.js or NGINX-based API gateway routes traffic, enforces authentication, applies rate-limiting, and aggregates data from multiple services.
7.3. Error Handling
Every endpoint includes centralized error handling with custom middleware for standardized responses and retries. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures during downstream outages.

8.	Frontend Design
The frontend uses React with Vite for fast builds, TailwindCSS for UI, and Redux Toolkit for state management.
8.1. Key Components
1.	Business Dashboard — CRUD interface for managing listings.
2.	Marketplace View — Displays available products and services.
3.	Chat Panel — Real-time messaging interface built with WebSocket hooks.
4.	Analytics Dashboard — Interactive charts (using Recharts or Chart.js).
5.	Agent Portal — Commission tracking and onboarding analytics.
6.	Admin Panel — Access-controlled interface for moderators.
8.2. User Experience Goals
•	Fast loading (under 3s on 3G).
•	Responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
•	Accessible (WCAG-compliant).
•	Intuitive layout with minimal learning curve.
________________________________________
9.	Database Schema
GoOnline uses PostgreSQL with normalized tables and foreign key relationships. Key entities include:
•	users (id, name, email, role, password_hash)
•	businesses (id, owner_id, name, category, description, status)
•	products (id, business_id, name, price, stock)
•	orders (id, product_id, customer_id, status, created_at)
•	payments (id, order_id, amount, method, status)
•	commissions (id, agent_id, business_id, rate, amount)
•	messages (id, chat_id, sender_id, body, timestamp)
Indexes are optimized for read operations and frequent queries. Redis caches business listings and chat data for performance.

10.	Scalability and Fault Tolerance
10.1. Scalability
•	Horizontal Scaling: Multiple replicas of each service behind a load balancer.
•	Database Partitioning: Large tables are sharded by region.
•	Caching: Redis reduces load on the primary database.
•	Asynchronous Processing: RabbitMQ handles slow tasks (emails, reports).
10.2. Fault Tolerance
•	Redundant Instances: Multi-zone deployment prevents downtime.
•	Health Checks: Kubernetes probes automatically restart failed pods.
•	Circuit Breakers: Prevent cascading failures.
•	Data Backups: Nightly PostgreSQL snapshots with off-site storage.
•	Graceful Degradation: Non-critical features (chat, analytics) temporarily disable during outages.

11.	Collaboration and Communication
11.1. Real-Time Chat
The collaboration service uses WebSockets with Redis Pub/Sub for broadcasting messages to connected clients. Messages are persisted for audit purposes.
11.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Four primary roles exist:
•	Owner — full control over business data.
•	Admin — manages products, orders, and agents.
•	Agent — onboards businesses and earns commissions.
•	Viewer — read-only access to listings and reports.
11.3. Shared Workspaces
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) structures enable simultaneous edits on shared documents such as inventory lists without conflicts.
